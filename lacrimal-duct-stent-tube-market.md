<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lacrimal Duct Stent Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocanalicular Lacrimal Duct Stent Tube</li><li>Bicanalicular Lacrimal Duct Stent Tube</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lacrimal duct stent tube market is categorized into two main types: monocanalicular and bicanalicular stent tubes. Monocanalicular stent tubes are designed for single canal placement, facilitating tear drainage when one canal is obstructed. In contrast, bicanalicular stent tubes are used in both canaliculi, allowing for dual drainage, which can be more effective in managing severe lacrimal duct blockages. Both types are essential in ophthalmic procedures to restore normal tear flow and prevent complications like chronic tearing.</p></p>
