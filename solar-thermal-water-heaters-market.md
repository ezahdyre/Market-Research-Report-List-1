<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Thermal Water Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure-bearing Solar Water Heater</li><li>Non-pressure Solar Water Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar thermal water heaters are categorized into pressure-bearing and non-pressure systems. Pressure-bearing solar water heaters maintain water under pressure, allowing them to supply hot water at higher elevations and efficiently distribute it throughout a building. They are ideal for larger installations. In contrast, non-pressure solar water heaters operate without pressurization, making them simpler and more cost-effective but suitable mainly for low-pressure applications like residential use in single-story homes. Each type caters to specific user needs and installation constraints.</p></p>
